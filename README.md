# _begin

_begin is my adaptation of a popular WordPress starter theme [Roots](https://github.com/roots/roots). 


## Installation

Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/roots/roots.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/roots/roots/zipball/master) and then rename the directory to the name of your theme or website.

### Install Grunt and Bower

**Unfamiliar with npm? Don't have node installed?** [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) before proceeding.

From the command line:

1. Install `grunt-cli` and `bower` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`.
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at `package.json` and automatically install the necessary dependencies. It will also automatically run `bower install`, which installs front-end packages defined in `bower.json`.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.

### Available Grunt commands

* `grunt dev` — Compile LESS to CSS, concatenate and validate JS
* `grunt watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `grunt build` — Create minified assets that are used on non-development environments

## Configuration

Edit `lib/config.php` to enable or disable theme features and to define a Google Analytics ID.

Edit `lib/init.php` to setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, post formats, and sidebars.
